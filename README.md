Fix for the English Language C64 version of [Zak McKracken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_McKracken_and_the_Alien_Mindbenders) to re-empower Annie.

A bug in the original C64 version of Zak McKracken recently surfaced during a live playthrough
[YouTube Conversations with Curtis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ5CpEy4sio).
It prevented Annie from picking up the precious yellow crystal shard.
In most user experiences and playthroughs this action is carried out by Zak, though, which is why this bug remained unknown
for **36 years**.

From the live audience the user *ATM* confirmed this bug to be present for the V1 versions of the game. Namely, C64 and the first MS-DOS variant.
Robert Megone hunted down the corresponding SCUMM script with its changes between V1 and V2:

The scene in question:\
![Screenshot.\label{fig:Annie, unable to pick up the crystal}](fix.png)

Buggy script:
```js
[0000] (48) if (VAR_ACTIVE_VERB == 14) {
[0006] (08)   if (VAR_EGO != 2) {
[000C] (2F)     if (!getState04(169)) {
[0011] (6F)       if (getState04(114)) {
[0016] (D8)         printEgo("This looks like an artifact!");
[0030] (18)       } else {
[0033] (D8)         printEgo("I wonder who would know what this is.");
[0053] (**)       }
[0053] (**)     }
[0053] (D0)     pickupObject(VAR_ACTIVE_OBJECT1);
[0055] (62)     stopScript(0);
[0057] (**)   }
[0057] (**) }
```

The `pickupObject` is only carried out for actors that are not Annie (`VAR_EGO != 2`),
which looks like a very human error of block hierarchy. Note, that this text form of the script
is not the original scripting language but a decompilation from [SCUMM-Decompilation-Archive](https://github.com/EricOakford/SCUMM-Decompilation-Archive).
You may want to refer to [*The Mansion â€“ Technical Aspects*](https://www.pagetable.com/?p=603) for details on the C64 scripts.

Working script of V2:
```js
[0000] (48) if (VAR_ACTIVE_VERB == 14) {
[0006] (D0)   pickupObject(VAR_ACTIVE_OBJECT1);
[0008] (08)   if (VAR_EGO != 2) {
[000E] (2F)     if (!getState04(169)) {  #a9
[0013] (6F)       if (getState04(114)) { #72
[0018] (D8)         printEgo("This looks like an artifact!");
[0032] (18)       } else {
[0035] (D8)         printEgo("I wonder who would know what this is.");
[0055] (**)       }
[0055] (**)     }
[0055] (62)     stopScript(0);
[0057] (**)   }
[0057] (**) }
```

The next step was to locate the corresponding byte code of this script in the C64 game data.
It resides on disk 2.
The data in `[]` refers to the relative address offset within the byte code.\
The hexdecimal number in `()` relates to the actual OPCODE while the additional data on the left reflects
the actual byte code including all parameters.\
The buggy byte code:

```js
75
48 08 0e 00 51 00           #[0000] (48) if (VAR_ACTIVE_VERB == 14) {
08 00 02 00 4b 00           #[0008] (08)   if (VAR_EGO != 2) {
2f a9 00 42 00              #[000E] (2F)     if (!getState04(169)) {  #a9
6f 72 00 1d 00              #[0013] (6F)       if (getState04(114)) { #72
d8 54 68 69 f3 6c 6f 6f 6b
f3 6c 69 6b e5 61 ee 61 72
74 69 66 61 63 74 21 00     #[0018] (D8) printEgo("This looks like an artifact!");
18 20 00                    #[0032] (18)       } else {
d8 c9 77 6f 6e 64 65 f2 77
68 ef 77 6f 75 6c e4 6b 6e
6f f7 77 68 61 f4 74 68 69
f3 69 73 2e 00              #[0035] (D8) printEgo("I wonder who would know what this is.");
d0 09                       #(D0)   pickupObject(VAR_ACTIVE_OBJECT1);}
62 00                       #[0055] (62)     stopScript(0);
```

The new data after the patch was applied:
```js
77
48 08 0e 00 51 00           #[0000] (48) if (VAR_ACTIVE_VERB == 14) {
d0 09                       #(D0)   pickupObject(VAR_ACTIVE_OBJECT1);}
08 00 02 00 49 00           #[0008] (08)   if (VAR_EGO != 2) {
2f a9 00 42 00              #[000E] (2F)     if (!getState04(169)) {  #a9
6f 72 00 1d 00              #[0013] (6F)       if (getState04(114)) { #72
d8 54 68 69 f3 6c 6f 6f 6b
f3 6c 69 6b e5 61 ee 61 72
74 69 66 61 63 74 21 00     #[0018] (D8) printEgo("This looks like an artifact!");
18 20 00                    #[0032] (18)       } else {
d8 c9 77 6f 6e 64 65 f2 77
68 ef 77 6f 75 6c e4 6b 6e
6f f7 77 68 61 f4 74 68 69
f3 69 73 2e 00              #[0035] (D8) printEgo("I wonder who would know what this is.");
62 00                       #[0055] (62)     stopScript(0);
```

Note, that the `pickupObject` was injected earlier, causing the relative jump to the end of the the second IF CLAUSE to become shorter by two bytes
(`0x4b` -> `0x49`) which also affected the script EOR checksum and required a change from `0x75` to `0x77` to produce a valid byte code.
The patched disk image was confirmed to fix the issue and allow a complete playthrough of this incredibly amazing game.

## Usage
Run this Python3 script with the name of the original disk image for Side 2 as a parameter:
*Note: Only the English language release is currently supported.*
```bash
python patch_diskimage.py side2.d64
```
The patched disk image is written as a new file.
```bash
6934f1a3c3c16cd6ca9ef0c31c7e0170  side2_patch.d64
```
